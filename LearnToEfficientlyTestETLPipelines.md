### Saff Squeeze
1. Inline Everything
1. Move asserts up and delete everything that's not needed from the bottom.
2. Keep going until you find the code important for your bug
3. Delete anything that's unused from the top
4. Cache or refactor to reduce what's needed from the top
5. Simplify your inputs until they are the minimum needed to reproduce your bug
6. You have a smaller test!

After Jay and I had our conversation, J.B. Rainsberger wrote a really good blog describing this technique in detail. [Check it out here!](https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/the-saff-squeeze)

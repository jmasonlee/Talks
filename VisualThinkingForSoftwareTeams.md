## The Visual-Spatial Identifier description
The version of the Visual Saptial identifier I used was in Temple Grandin's book on Visual Thinking. She cites:  
Silverman, L.K. _Upside-Down Brilliance: The Visual-Spatial Learner._ Denver: Deleon, 2002.  
I can't find a reference to that online, but this article is written by a collaborator and gives a decent summary with a slightly different version of the questionnaire:
